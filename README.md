# cseuoi-thesis

This is the official XeLaTeX template for Master's theses and Ph.D. dissertations used at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina](http://cse.uoi.gr/).

In order to use this template, you must first install a TeX distribution.
For example, you can install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) on Ubuntu using the command ```sudo apt-get install texlive-full```.
Then, install [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) or another TeX editor of your choice.
Finally, open the SampleThesis.tex file with your TeX editor and compile it with XeLaTeX.

The cseuoi-thesis template enables typesetting of Master's theses and Ph.D. dissertations in Greek, as well as in English, by using the [xgreek](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/xgreek?lang=en) package.
Details about the requirements for publication can be found in the sample files and in the Guide of Studies.

SampleThesisMsc.pdf is a sample MSc in advanced computer systems thesis, produced using the template. It contains instructions on how to use the template.
The other pdf files show how the first few pages differ from SampleThesisMsc.pdf, for the PhD and MSc documents, in both Greek and English.

## Fonts
For the main text, the freely available *GFS Didot* fonts are required (most probably, they are already installed with TeX Live). The typewritter font is *Ubuntu Mono*, which can be found here (`Template/Font`), in case it is not already installed on your system.

## Instructions for MS Word template

The word template, in file templateMSW16.docx, is based on the equivalent template from [Kansas State University](https://www.k-state.edu/grad/etdr/template/). Their website is highly recommended for excellent advice and troubleshooting information. You should read it before you start writing!
The pdf output can be seen in templateMSW16.pdf.

Note that the provided Word template is not 100% compliant to the cseuoi-thesis template and requires some manual modification. It is up to the author to make the necessary changes on their own.
Moreover, it is provided only for the MSc in Data and Computer Systems Engineering and in the Greek language.
**It may also be used for the MSc in Computer Science by making some modifications in the cover and abstact (in both Greek and English).
An example is shown in file CS_MSC_SYS_GR.pdf (see the highlighted parts).**

In general, formating long complicated documents in Word is very fragile and small modifications can make a large difference in the appearence of the document.
Be very carefull on where you click and type. Even hitting undo cannot restore it back in its previous form in some cases.

It is strongly advised to use the draft mode with all the special symbols visiblle for entering text using the appropriate style each time.
See [this link from KSU](https://www.k-state.edu/grad/etdr/word/word13/styles.html) for advice on how to set up your environment.

Most of the text uses the Body Text style.
Chapter titles use Heading 1, while Heading 2 and 3 are used for sections and subsections.
Appendix titles use Heading 6 and their sections use Heading 7 and subsections Heading 8.
Text in theorems etc, use the Math style.
The Page Heading TOC style is used for section titles (e.g. Bibliography) which appear in the table of contents,
while Page Heading is used for the remaining section titles.


### Known problems
* The Apendix numbering is using Latin capital letters, instead of Greek. This affects the appendix titles, captions and references to figures, tables etc in the appendices. Workaround: manual editing of the final document. Be consistent and fix them all!
* References to figures, tables and algorithms in the List of figures/tables/algorithms contain the word figure/table/algorithm, which is **not** compatible with the cseuoi-thesis template. Workaround: Convert the automatically generated TOC and Lists to text and edit it. This must happen at the final document.
* Similarly, in the table of contents, the word chapter/appendix should be removed. Workaround: as above.
* The word Chapter/Appendix in the corresponding titles is not in small caps but in caps. Moreover, it is not always left justified. Workaround: Manual editing of the final document.
* The spacing above all top-level headings (Heading 1, Heading 6, Page Heading TOC, Page Heading) is ignored by Word (at least in 2016 mac version) when the heading is at the top of a page. As a workaround a blank line of Body Text is included at the top of the page, followed by the heading with reduced vertical space above. Do not remove the extra blank line!
* Reference types are sometimes lost. Moreover, Table, Figure and Equation reference types sometimes change unexpectedly to Greek! Thus existing figures etc. are not visible when trying to enter a new cross-reference. Workaround: If this happens, enter new dummy captions for every lost reference type and define a new label (type of reference) which matches exactly the pre-existing names (be carefull some start with a lowercase letter): Figure, Table, Equation, Algorithm, Theorem, Lemma, Corollary, Observation, definition, fact, remark. Then remove the new dummy caption and fix the numbering of the remaining captions by doing "Update Field" on all of them.
* Inserting a cross reference to a Chapter, Appendix, figure, table, etc. automatically includes the word Appendix, Chapter, Figure, Table, etc. In the case of Chapter and Appendix, the words are in caps, which is ugly. In addition conjugated forms of these words are not automatically generated. A simple workaround is to and replace these by hand, at the final version. A more complicated workaround is to insert the correct form of the word Chapter, figure, etc and edit the field code (grey text) generated by Word to get just the corresponding number: Press Alt-F9 to view the field code and add `\# "x.0x"` between the code `_Refxxxx` and `\h` (which is used to link to the referenced item). Switch back to normal view of field codes (alt-F9 again) and do Update Field (an option in the right click menu). In many cases, you have to do Update Field multiple times for the change to take effect.
