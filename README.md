# cseuoi-thesis


** IMPORTANT NOTE: DEPRECATED; MEANT FOR THE OLD MSC PROGRAM **

 _This particular branch in now defunct and was used for the old "**MSc in Computer Science**" graduate program. Please use the `master` branch to correctly produce your thesis for the current graduate program of the Department._

This is the official XeLaTeX template for Master's theses used at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina](http://cse.uoi.gr/).

In order to use this template, you must first install a TeX distribution.
For example, you can install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) on Ubuntu using the command ```sudo apt-get install texlive-full```.
Then, install [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) or another TeX editor of your choice.
Finally, open the SampleThesis.tex file with your TeX editor and compile it with XeLaTeX.

The cseuoi-thesis template enables typesetting of Master's theses and Ph.D. dissertations in Greek, as well as in English, by using the [xgreek](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/xgreek?lang=en) package.
Details about the requirements for publication can be found in the sample files and in the Guide of Studies.

## Fonts
For the main text, the freely available *GFS Didot* fonts are required (most probably, they are already installed with TeX Live). The typewritter font is *Ubuntu Mono*, which can be found here (`Template/Font`), in case it is not already installed on your system.
